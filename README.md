# Unicoder
This repo provides the code for reproducing the experiments in [XGLUE: A New Benchmark Dataset for Cross-lingual Pre-training, Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01401) ([`leaderboard`](https://microsoft.github.io/XGLUE/ "https://microsoft.github.io/XGLUE/")).

We provide three models, Unicoder for understanding tasks, Unicoder for generation tasks (pre-trained with xDAE) and Unicoder for generation tasks (pre-trained with xFNP).

# Updates
**Code for XLM-K**: we add the code for [XLM-K: Improving Cross-Lingual Language Model Pre-Training with Multilingual Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12573) at [here](./pretraining/xlmk/README.md).

## Unicoder for understanding tasks
We share a 12-layers model which is pre-trained with 100 languages.

This code can reproduce the experiments on 9 understanding XGLUE tasks: NER,
POS Tagging (POS),
News Classification (NC),
MLQA,
XNLI,
PAWS-X,
Query-Ad Matching (QADSM),
Web Page Ranking (WPR),
QA Matching (QAM).

For more details, you can go to [understanding README](./understanding/README.md).

## Unicoder for generation tasks (pre-trained with xDAE)
We share a 12-layer encoder and 12-layer decoder model which is pre-trained with 100 languages.

The code can reproduce the experiments on 2 generation XGLUE tasks: News Title Generation(NTG) and Question Generation (QG).

For more details, you can go to [generation README](./generation/README.md).

## Unicoder for generation tasks (pre-trained with xFNP)
We share a 12-layer encoder and 12-layer decoder model which is pre-trained with 100 languages.

The code can reproduce the experiments on 2 generation XGLUE tasks: News Title Generation(NTG) and Question Generation (QG).
